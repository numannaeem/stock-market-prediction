Gonna be real with you, I shamelessly ripped this off from some website online. Don't have the slightest clue what an LSTM or SVM even is. But this was decent enough to get me an A on my ML project, so I'm leaving it here in case someone else is desperate enough to use it.

Feel free to go through the code and figure out how it all works, if you care enough.

Steps to get this working:
1. `git clone https://github.com/numannaeem/stock-market-prediction.git`
2. `pip install requirements.txt`
3. `py lstm.py` or `py svm.py` -> This runs the corresponding algorithm and gives you two fancy looking graphs, something like this:
