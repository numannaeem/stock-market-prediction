Gonna be very honest, I ripped this off from some online tutorial. But it was decent enough to get me an A-grade on my ML project, so I'm leaving this here in case it helps anyone else in the future.

Steps to get this working:
1. `git clone https://github.com/numannaeem/stock-market-prediction.git`
2. `pip install requirements.txt`
3. `py lstm.py` or `py svm.py` -> This runs the corresponding algorithm and gives you two fancy looking graphs (real values v/s predicted values).

I have no idea what an "LSTM" or an "SVM" is, but feel free to go through the code and figure out what happens behind the scenes, if you care.
